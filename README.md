Wired is an ORM for PHP.

Key features:

* Light itself, uses light dependencies.
* Not a part of a framework.
* Supports table prefixes.
* No external configuration (except database connection), models are configured in the models classes.
* No static facades, only explicit delivery using dependency injection.
* Has a query builder.
* Exceptions on errors.
* Build on top of small modules which can be used separately (e.g. 
  [query builder](https://github.com/FinesseRus/QueryScribe), 
  [database connector](https://github.com/FinesseRus/MicroDB)).

Supported DBMSs:

* MySQL
* SQLite
* PostrgeSQL (partially, see [the issue](https://github.com/FinesseRus/MicroDB#known-problems))

If you need a new database system support please implement it [there](https://github.com/FinesseRus/MicroDB) and 
[there](https://github.com/FinesseRus/QueryScribe) using pull requests.
